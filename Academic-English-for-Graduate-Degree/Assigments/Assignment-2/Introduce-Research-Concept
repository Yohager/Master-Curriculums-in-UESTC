Introduce a Research Concept in my field

my topic is the concept about nash equilibrium

two different groups of audience: one is the public from all walks of life , the other is undergraduate students

First I would introduce the nash equilibrium to the public. Hello everyone, Today I want to talk something about nash equilibrium.
Nash equilibrium is a concept from game theory.  It is very easy to understand. Now imaging a situation 
that you love a girl, you become good friends and the girl considers you as a very good friend. Actually,in that case you will not to confess your 
feelings that you love her because if you are rejected since then you can not be good friends.while the girl is also unwilling to refuse you
because she is also fear to lose a good friend. That will not be a good result for her. So in this situation that you are in 
a Nash Equilibrium which means at present both of you are not willing to break the state between yourselves. because both of you 
think the current stateis the best case for each other.

Second I would like to introduce the nash equilibrium to the undergraduate students. Hello our guys, today I want to share one concept
named "Nash Equilibrium". It was first proposed by john nash in game theory. This concept describes that when in a game process. whatever 
the strateies that other people take, you are going to choose one certain decision which will always maximize your utility. Also the same for 
others. That means everyone in this game has nothing to gain by changing only their own stratey. Nash Equilibrium is a vital concept in game
theory and economic theory. Scientists use Nash Equilibrium to analyze the outcome of the strategic interaction of several decision
makers. If you are interesting about it you can google for more details.
