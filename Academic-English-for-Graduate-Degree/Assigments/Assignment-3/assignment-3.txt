A short report for three parts problems

From my perspective, I suppose the lecturer delivers this speech in purpose of making people get out of
pessimism and depression. The potient audience of the speech can be those patients or who are familiar with
them and willing to help them get rid of it. Actually, the speaker makes a great speech. First of all, the
idea of the speech is very clear. It follows the order of causality that we find the depression trouble, analyze
why so many people suffer from depression, then we are going to figure out solutions to solve it and finally give
a great conclusion. Aonther part I believe the speaker does efficiently is the main content of the advice. It covers
both physical and psychological parts which are really practical.
