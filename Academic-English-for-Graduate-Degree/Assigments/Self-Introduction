Hello, everyone. My name is Guo Yuhang. 
I am a first-year graduate student in the school of computer science in UESTC.
The most distinctive characteristics of me can be concluded as two words: 
Energetic and Star Struck
I have board interests like music and sports. I go running regularly and I love the feeling of 
sweating. In my spare time, I love playing guitar and piano. Also I have participated in 
many orgizations like student union, supporting education team and some clubs.
So I suppose I am a person full of dynamic who is always ready to try differnent novelities.

The second idiosyncrasy of me is star struck. I am a big fan for the band MayDay for about eight years.
I love to go to their vocal concert and buy their albums.
Their songs and experiences really inspire me when I am bothered with some 
trivial matters or just take a hit in some aspects.
